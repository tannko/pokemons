## Steps to run an app
1. Install dependencies for both client and server, e.g. 
    ```
    cd server
    npm install
    cd client
    npm install 
    ```
2. Start the server with node index.js from server folder. e.g
    ```
    cd server
    node index.js
    ```
3. Start the client with npm start from client folder, e.g 
    ```
    cd client
    npm start
    ```
